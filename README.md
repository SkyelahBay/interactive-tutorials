# CodePlatoon learn-js.org assignment #
Since I couldn't figure out a good way to show that I completed this assignment, I decided to just fork the original repo that was listed at the end of the assignment, and simply drop my answer in there. 

 - To view my solutions, go to ```/tutorials/learn-js.org/en``` and look at the ```"solution"``` section where I copied my answer from the actual assignment, into the github repo.
