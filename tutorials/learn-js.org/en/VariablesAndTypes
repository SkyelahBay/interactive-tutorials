/* You must define the following variables:
    1. A number called myNumber which contains the number `4`;
    2. A string called myString which contains the sentence `Variables are great.`;
    3. A boolean called myBoolean which contains the value `false`;

EXAMPLE
console.log("myNumber is equal to " + myNumber);
console.log("myString is equal to " + myString);
console.log("myBoolean is equal to " + myBoolean);
*/

/* SOLUTION */
let myNumber = 4,
    myString = "Variables are great.",
    myBoolean = false;
    
console.log(`myNumber is equal to ${myNumber}`);
console.log(`myString is equal to ${myString}`);
console.log(`myBoolean is equal to ${myBoolean}`);
