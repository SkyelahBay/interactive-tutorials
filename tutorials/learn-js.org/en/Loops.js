// In this exercise, you must write a for loop that iterates on the myArray variable and prints out all of its members.

/* EXAMPLE 
var myArray = ["What is the meaning of life?", "The meaning of life is", 42];

// TODO: modify this code
for ()
{
}
*/


/* SOLUTION */
let myArray = [
    "What is the meaning of life?",
    "The meaning of life is", 
    42
];

myArray.forEach((value)=>console.log(value));
